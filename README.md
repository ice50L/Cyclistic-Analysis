# Cyclistic-Analysis

# Introduction
Hello! This repo contains a case study using the programming language R. The company and dataset are fictional for the purpose for up and coming data analysts! The case study focuses on a company "Cyclistic". The focus on the case study is to answer the main question of how casual bike riders and members use the Cyclistic bikes in a different manner. This is all based on the data collected from the previous 12 months. The CyclisticData.rmd file contains the data analyzed from the given datasets.

# About

In this case study project, I am acting as a data analyst for the fictional company "Cyclistic" which is based in Chicago. My goal is to showcase the difference between casual riders and members. The director of marketing believes that in order to maximize the number of annual memberships, we must first know the difference bewtween both riders by the form of visualization and data backing it up. There are 3 plans offered by the company, single pass, full day pass, and the annual plan. Both the single and day pass are referred to as casual riders, while annual members are referred to as simply members. 

The finance analysts of Cyclistic has determined that anmnual memberships are more profitable than single and day passes, therefore their goal is to convert as many casual members to annual members. The goal of me as a data analyst is present data to the other deparments in order for them to determine the right approach to convert casual members into annual members. 

# Questions and Beliefs

*Where does casual members and annual members differ?
*People who are already casual members will be easier to convert than bringing in new members.
*What is the difference on amount of people that are casual versus annual? 

# Data Visualization and description

From the given data, it can be suggested that casual riders are more active during the weekends compared to members who are more active during the weekdays. This could be a result of casual members purchasing their day/single passes in order to travel around or exercise outside a work day, while annual members are more attracted to the prospect of using the bikes to get to work/school. During the weekdays, the difference in amount of riders is substantial compared to the weekends where casual riders overtake annual members in riders.

Casual members on average appears to spend more time riding Cyclistic's bikes on average compared to annual members, which is surprising. Annual members appear to have about a constant average amount of time spent riding the bikes daily, while casual members have more activity in the weekends and at the start and end of the week.

There appears to be a preference for the bike types. There appears to be about 1.78 million riders that are annual members that ride the classic bike, while at the same time, there are 0 annual members that ride the docked bike.
